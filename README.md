a flexible way to drive 7-segment leds

Taken from my serial display project, this set of routines offer flexible pin arrangement in driving 4-digit LED displays.

User needs to provide a set of routines to affectuate pin logic states, like IO_SET()/IO_CLR()/IO_OUT(). I provided a set of them for most popular MCUs here.
